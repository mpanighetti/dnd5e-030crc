# October 5th (Challenge 4)

Prompt: **Parasite**

## [Cuckoo Mimic](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/monstrosities/cuckoo-mimic.md)

### Lore

The adventurers cannot remember a time when Reginald was not among them, though they are hard-pressed to recall when they first met. He's just seemingly always been there, fighting alongside them in difficult encounters, sharing drinks at the local tavern, taking turns keeping vigilant watch over their sleeping innocent forms in the dark wilderness at night. Reggie is their comrade, their friend, their protector, their lover, and they would all readily sacrifice themselves to protect him, as they assume he would for them. That's just the special connection they share, as they definitely always have.

This party has been tricked by an insidious variety of parasitic mimic, which leaves its egg with traveling groups as they sleep. The egg emits a psychic aura that creates false memories of a tight familial bond between each slumbering group member and the unborn creature. Once the connection is established, the egg hatches, and the mimic takes a form comfortable to its hosts, who then wake up none the wiser of the intrusion. To them, this "person" has been a constant companion, and they feel a deep-seated compulsion to protect it at all costs.

Specific connections and memories are created based on the predilections of each individual; some might think of the mimic as a blood relation, others as a romantic interest.

The cuckoo mimic's longterm goals are to develop and thrive long enough to reproduce with one of its hosts and seed its offspring in another traveling party, continuing its cycle of brood parasitism. If it detects that one of its hosts questions its presence among the party, it will plot to either kill or defame the would-be accuser to remove them from the group. Sometimes this effort is so successful that it can even convince its other hosts to carry out the deed.

_**Affable Form.**_ When the cuckoo mimic first joins a group, it chooses a humanoid form based on different attributes of all its hosts. For any attributes of the mimic's stat block based on a random host, a different host is picked at random for each selection. These selections are permanent as long as the mimic remains with its hosts, and potentially change as a host's features change. For example, if the mimic's speed is based on a monk host, it will increase as the monk gains speed from its Unarmored Movement feature. These changes have the same requirements as they have for the host; in the previous example, if the mimic is wearing armor, it does not gain the additional speed.

### Special Traits

_**Adhesive.**_ The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 14). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The mimic can choose to suppress this trait at any time.

_**Brood Parasitism.**_ When the cuckoo mimic is about to hatch from its egg, all humanoids within 60 feet of it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw; the saving throw DC increases to 18 and is made with disadvantage if the humanoid is unconscious. On a failed save, the humanoid is charmed by the mimic.

While charmed in this manner, a host believes the mimic is someone close to them, their memories are altered to indicate that the mimic has been a part of their lives for an extended time period, and they are compelled to protect the mimic at all costs, including self-sacrifice. The host justifies any inconsistencies found in its altered memories in order to maintain the delusion. The mimic has a persistent psychic connection with all of its hosts, which allows it to know each host's altered memories and surface-level emotions.

This charm effect lasts until the mimic dies. If the mimic deals damage to the host, they can repeat their Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save.

_**Grappler.**_ The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by its Adhesive trait.

_**Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).**_ The mimic’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: _mind sliver_

3/day: _mind spike_

### Actions

_**Pseudopod.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic so chooses, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait if hit by this attack.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.

_**Change Shape.**_ The mimic polymorphs into a humanoid of the same race of a random host, or back into its true form, which is amorphous but vaguely humanoid in shape. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
