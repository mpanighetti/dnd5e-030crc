# October 4th (Challenge 3)

Prompt: **Spoopy**

### [Grinning Gourd](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/plants/grinning-gourd.md)

#### Lore

A common decoration for autumnal harvest festivals involves coring a large pumpkin, carving a smiling or scowling face, and placing a lit candle inside. These "grinning gourds" cast their expressions into eerie flickering shadows but mostly provide a harmless spooky ambience. In some cases, however, these visages are twisted by sinister magic to serve the caster's nefarious purposes.

A grinning gourd animated by a magic candle in this manner has no sentience but serves its creator dutifully. They are sometimes employed as covert guards or remote eyes, though their usefulness in these efforts might be limited outside of harvest seasons. Would-be intruders that do not take notice of the gourds can be quickly subdued by their thorny vines until their creator arrives to confront the new captives. If the plants are overpowered, they immediately release their magical lifeforce as their candles explode, dealing one final blow to their opponents and possibly setting off a chain reaction for any other gourds in the vicinity.

#### Special Traits

_**Explode.**_ When the grinning gourd is reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately explodes in a concussive blast of flame. All creatures within a 20-foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (3d10) fire damage and is knocked prone. On a succesful save, the fire damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone.

_**False Appearance.**_ While the grinning gourd remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal jack-o'-lantern.

_**Flickering Flame.**_ As long as the gourd has hit points remaining, it emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

#### Actions

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) fire damage.

_**Constrict.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ The target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled in the gourd's vines (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The grinning gourd cannot use its Constrict action as long as it has a creature grappled in this manner.

#### Bonus Actions

_**Reel.**_ The grinning gourd reels in its vines to either move next to a constricted target without spending movement, or to move the constricted creature toward the gourd if the creature is smaller than the gourd or prone.
