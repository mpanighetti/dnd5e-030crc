# October 1st (Challenge 0)

Prompt: **Trick-or-Treat**

### [Trickered Treat](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/trickered-treat.md)

#### Lore

A creation of hags tired of Feywild children demanding sweets at all hours of the night, trickered treats are animated candies designed to look as inviting and appetizing as possible, so that they might tempt would-be victims into having a taste. Such temptations are short-lived, as the candies will immediately assail anyone interacting with them, taking careful aim at the creature's mouth and pummeling their teeth until they retreat. The treats are theoretically edible, but are coated with a putrefying concoction that will cause the most steel-hearted consumer's stomach to lurch violently.

_**Constructed Nature.**_ Trickered treats do not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

_**Sugar Rush.**_ Even though trickered treats are toxic to consume, they can still confer useful benefits to anyone who can stomach them. A Small or larger creature may swallow a Grappled, Restrained, or Incapacitated trickered treat. Doing so instantly destroys the treat, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, the creature is Poisoned for 1 hour, and cannot regain Hit Points while Poisoned in this manner. On a successful save, the creature gains the effects of the _haste_ spell for 1 minute (no Concentration required).

The target has Disadvantage on this Saving Throw if they have previously taken Poison damage from a trickered treat in the last day.
