Prompt: **Supernatural**

### Fallen Angel

#### Description

Though an angelic being is generally honor-bound to the god it serves, on occasion one will question its orders and potentially defy them. An angel that falls in this manner loses some of its connection to its deity's divine grace.

Perhaps the most famous fallen angel is Zariel, who made a deal with Asmodeus to become an archdevil and rule over Avernus. But the act of falling does not guarantee succumbing to a path of of evil. Fallen angels, perhaps even more than before they fell, have a freedom to determine their own fates, and most often take on an indifferent stance in terms of the Blood War or the affairs of Mount Celestia. Whatever compelled the angel to fall might drive it to maintain its independence and autonomy.

Even after falling from grace, an angel will typically retain ownership of its angel blade, a powerful weapon designed to pierce evil hearts. It is perhaps a slight oversight of the blade's creators that it is equally effective against other angels, and that this power persists even in the hands of mortals. A rare person that comes across an angel blade will find itself in possession of a mighty power to wield against any foe.

#### Angel Blade

_Weapon (Longsword), Rare, Requires Attunement_

These silvery blades are standard issue for all frontline celestial soldiers in a god's army. They are similar in appearance to a mortal sword, but have been blessed with holy energies to effectively smite unbelievers.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a Celestial, Fiend, or evil-aligned creature with the Angel Blade, the attack is a Critical Hit and ignores Resistance for all damage dealt as part of the attack.
