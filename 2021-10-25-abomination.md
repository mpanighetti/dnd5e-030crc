Prompt: **Abomination**

### Bears Repeating

#### Description

Just as we dare not speak the bear's true name for fear of summoning its wrath, there is a turn of phrase of equal power and danger that would be best avoided. It comes up innocently enough in casual conversation, when a point has been previously made and is reiterated for emphasis, but this simple statement is enough to draw the ire of a terrifying ursine threat from outside of time and space.

At first glance, the summoned bear appears similar to a normal brown bear, which would already be sufficiently alarming given its sudden appearance and immediate aggression. But its true nature is revealed to anyone foolish enough to engage it in combat without finishing it off. Similar to a hydra, slaying this particular bear will only cause one's problems to double, as two bears appear in its place to continue its rage and destruction. Each new bear shares the same magical properties of the original bear, and the threat is further compounded the more the bears are threatened.

Plainly put, this abomination poses significant a threat to all of existence. Bears ad infinitum will ravage the natural order, fell entire kingdoms, and clog the oceans with ever-replicating bear carcasses. Any attempt at countering this onslaught only further empowers it.

The dangers cannot be overstated. It certainly bears repeating that— oh no. What have I done? I've condemned us all! I hear it now! The heavy thuds of its feet shake the earth as it walks, its fangs gnash at the air as if preparing to clamp down on its prey, the terrible roars echo down the halls... it's already in the house... it's too late for me. Go! Release your damnable notes to the world, let the people know how I doomed us to destruction!

It's bears repeating!

It's bears repeating!

IT'S BEARS REPEATING!

#### Traits
_**Keen Smell.**_ The bear has Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

_**Pack Tactics.**_ The bear has Advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the bear's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

_**Bears Repeating.**_ Once per world, when the barriers between planes are at their weakest, if someone speaks aloud the phrase "it bears repeating" in normal conversation, the bear is summoned from its slumber in a pocket dimension and appears in a random space within 20 feet of the speaker. This bear is identical in appearance to a brown bear. Upon being summoned, it viciously attacks all non-bear creatures it can see and will not stop fighting until it or the original summoner dies.

Additionally, if the bear takes damage but isn't reduced to 0 Hit Points, it splits into two new Bears Repeating with full Hit Points that share the original bear's aggression.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The bear makes a number of attacks equal to the total number of bears within 120 feet (including itself), alternating between its Bite and its Claws for each attack.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Attack Roll:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft.. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) Piercing damage.

_**Claws.**_ _Melee Attack Roll:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft.. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) Slashing damage.

#### Reactions

_**Endure (1/Bear).**_ When the bear is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it drops to 1 Hit Point instead, after which it splits as per its Bears Repeating trait.
