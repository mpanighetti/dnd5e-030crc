# October 2nd (Challenge 1)

Prompt: **Capitalism**

### [Avatar of Debt](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/undead/avatar-of-debt.md)

#### Lore

> 'Tis impossible to be sure of any thing but Death and Taxes.

— _The Cobbler of Preston_

On worlds where coinage and wealth dictate one's societal worth and position of power, taxes can be the great equalizer. Monarchs and paupers alike have fallen to the mighty tax collector, and so too do the mightiest adventurers eventually have to account for the mountains of wealth accrued during their escapades. For a very unlucky few, this rebalancing comes in the form of an audit from an avatar of debt.

Though the scythe of this grim spectre looks intimidating, it draws neither blood nor vitality. It instead cuts directly into the purse of whoever sits on the receiving end, reducing one's wealth with every blow. This taxman will not relent until one's entire balance is withdrawn, insisting that "the debt must be paid".

Any taxes the avatar collects are stowed away in a pocket dimension only they can access. If the avatar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, their pocket dimension collapses and their collected taxes appear on the ground where they previously stood.

##### Summoning an Avatar of Debt

The Dungeon Master may opt to replace the Ruin card from a _Deck of Many Things_ with the Audit card, which behaves as follows when drawn:

_**Audit.**_ You summon an avatar of debt – a ghostly skeleton creature clad in a snappy business suit and burgundy tie, and carrying a spectral scythe. They appear in a space of the Dungeon Master's choice within 10 feet of you and attack you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights you until you have no more wealth or they drop to 0 Hit Points, whereupon they disappear. If anyone besides you tries to attack the avatar, they summon their own avatar of debt. A creature whose wealth is reduced to 0 by an avatar of debt can't possess coinage for 3d10 days, during which time any coins they attempt to obtain disappear into the avatar's pocket dimension.

#### Attributes

_Medium undead, lawful evil_

- **Armor Class** 13
- **Hit Points** half the Hit Point Maximum of their summoner
- **Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  | CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|14 (+2)|17 (+3)|16 (+3)|20 (+5)|18 (+4)|4 (-3)|

- **Languages** all languages known of their summoner
- **Challenge** equal to the summoner's level or challenge rating, minimum 1 (200 XP)[^💀]

[^💀]: Technically, the avatar of debt breaks D&D's challenge rating system; in addition to their scaling Hit Point Maximum (similar to the avatar of death), the avatar cannot deal damage, and thus on its face presents no challenge beyond time spent. But the impact on wealth could be devastating to some players or campaigns, regardless of level. For the purpose of this project, we'll call the avatar a CR1, as a 1st level character should be able to defeat it, and in any case won't die even if the avatar wins the encounter.

#### Special Traits

_**Ledger Domain.**_ If the creature that summoned the avatar has no wealth in physical coinage, the avatar immediately teleports to their pocket dimension and cannot be summoned again by that creature for one year.

_**Desk Work.**_ The avatar is incapable of dealing damage to a creature.

_**Incorporeal Movement.**_ The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. They take 5 (1d10) Force damage if they end their turn inside an object.

_**Turning Immunity.**_ The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.

#### Actions

_**Taxes.**_ The avatar sweeps their spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of them. Roll a number of d12s equal to half the summoner's level or challenge rating (round down, minimum 1). A number of random coins equal to the dice roll immediately disappears from the target's wealth and reappears in the avatar's pocket dimension, and the avatar regains a number of Hit Points equal to the number of coins they take.

The tax is collected even if the creature's wealth is not under their current physical possession; the coins will be removed from any chest, bank, loan to another creature, extradimensional space, or any other location or plane, as long as the wealth exists as physical coinage.
