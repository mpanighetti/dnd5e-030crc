# Halloween Zero-to-Thirty Challenge Rating Challenge

This is a collection of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition homebrew monsters I created for the Halloween Zero-to-Thirty Challenge Rating Challenge (#030crc). Each day in October 2021 featured a monster (or collection of related monsters) of increasing challenge rating from CR0 to CR30, including lore, full monster stat blocks, and artwork.

## Rule Changes

This document makes the following modifications from _SRD 5.1_ and _SRD 5.2_:

- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on saving throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such saving throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
