Prompt: **The Deep**

### Giant Squid

#### Description

Giant squid are massive cephalopods found in the deepest oceans. Their remote habitat makes scholarly studies difficult, and most observations have been of dead specimen remains found floating on the water's surface. Even these findings have revealed important details, such as upper bounds on their size — at least 40 feet from mantle to the ends of their tentacles.

These creatures primarily feed on deep-sea fish and smaller squid species. They are territorial, fending off their waters even from other giant squid, engaging in vicious battles to maintain their domains. They mostly reside at the top of the food chain of deeper waters, having to only fear predation from sperm whales, kraken, and other such leviathans. Rare surface sightings are sometimes confused for krakens, but giant squid tend to be much less aggressive toward surface-dwellers, and have only occasionally been known to attack ships or swimmers when hunger sufficiently compels them to leave their territories.
